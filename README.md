# Mobile Flashcards

This app is the final project for the React Native course from the Udacity's React Nanodegree, where we had to build a flashcard mobile app.

The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks, for
study or learn subjects.
